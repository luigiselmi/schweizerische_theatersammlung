Start point

Bern theatres
first excel: data about Stadt Theatre (one theatre), contains all the fields, more than 100 years of data about the same theatre.

building the knowledge base from the source file: 
- finding the ontologies, 
- mapping fields in the data source to terms in ontology. 
- URI design per le entità: Persone, Teatri, Rappresentazioni etc. Dereferenziabilità (tool: Pubby http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/pubby/)
- disambiguation/reconciliation 
- populating the ontology
- storing the RDF data into a RDF triple store
- set up a sparql endpoint

- Interlinking (finding trusted repositories to provide data, set up a reconciliation service on top of the knowledge base)
- mapping, two ways:
	1) use openrefine and the RDF extension
	2) use an XSLT transformation

- disambiguation, two ways:
	1) based on a reconciliation service (OpenRefine Reconciliation Service)
	2) based on SILK and a SPARQL endpoint
	
	Maybe both could be supported. The first could be based on Stanbol.

- user interfaces for administrators and users
-- Adding new data 
	--batch procedure Based on Refine (add an autocompletion function).
        --add new data from a user interfaces with autocompletion
	 

- set up a server (ask for an account on a server provided by bfh like vmyuki)
- components to set up an RDF Store  

- set up a github repository for code and datasets



-- Evaluation of the effort for the mapping

--selection of ontologies or building a new ontology. MusicBrainz for persons and roles, Performances. covers everything but places and institutiuons. 
MusicBrainz web site is fine also for its UIs for users who want to make search and those who have the rights to add/update data  
MusicBrainz has a source code with GPL license for the source code. chabreyflint is the account.
VIAF web site Virtual International Authority File
Swiss National Library (vedere se possibile linkare entita autori dal loro sito)
IBDB International broadway Database: vedere la struttura dei teatri. utili i termini per le performances, show che non sono sono trattate in MusicBrainz

Attendo email con attach il file contenete i dati dei teatri con il nome e con i direttori succeduti nel tempo. 

the next meeting will be within the 1st week of June

What about multimedia content ? (see LMF)

License: which license they want to apply 
Data: how many files about performances like that for Bern Stadt Theater do they have and how many records ? To guess the size 
of the triple store


OpenRefine extension ?
